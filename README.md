# ATP Tracker

This is a web application for viewing ATP scores, tournament calendars, player rankings and other data.  It has a particular focus on being accessible to screen reader users, and hence it has no explicit visual styling at all.  It probably looks ugly, in other words.

It also doesn't track WTA data even though I'd really like it to.  I haven't yet managed to find a good data source for the WTA but when I do, my plan is to rename (or fork) this app and incorporate it in. The exclusion of the WTA is currently entirely based on technical limitations.
